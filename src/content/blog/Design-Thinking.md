title: Design Thinking
description: >-
  Design thinking is a non-linear, iterative process that teams use to
  understand users, challenge assumptions, redefine problems and create
  innovative solutions to prototype and test. It is most useful to tackle
  ill-defined or unknown problems and involves five phases: Empathize, Define,
  Ideate, Prototype and Test.

# Design Thinking

**It is a way** of designing what we are thinking about just like imagining a *hat and a stick* when thinking about magician. Imagining a light blub or question mark when thinking *about ideas etc*
