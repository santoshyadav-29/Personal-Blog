title: Design Thinking
description: >-
  Design thinking is a non-linear, iterative process that teams use to
  understand users, challenge assumptions, redefine problems and create
  innovative solutions to prototype and test. It is most useful to tackle
  ill-defined or unknown problems and involves five phases: Empathize, Define,
  Ideate, Prototype and Test.
